## TODO

## Feature ideas

- A pause system that slows down time until stopped, and then speeds up until normal speed on resume
- A noita-like modular weapon construction system

## Refactoring ideas

- combine all into one entity list
- use events to make it easier for us to have entities react to changes in other entities (e.g. ooh, X died, I should go scavenge, or become stronger / berserk)
