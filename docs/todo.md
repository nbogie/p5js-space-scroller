## TODO

## Feature ideas

- exploders can be shot only say 3 times, then they explode sending other shots everywhere, possibly in chain reaction.
- some exploders may give of fear spell / attract spell, and/or drop power-up.
- collectable power-ups
- allow weapon systems to process (or ignore) standard upgrades: shot-speed, shot number, dmg, fire rate, electric-dmg, fire-dmg, ice-dmg, shot spread increase/decrease, chain lightning, explosive...
- various mobs with different emergent behaviours through interactions and desires
- A noita-like modular weapon construction system

## Refactoring ideas

- sort type issues
- use events to make it easier for us to have entities react to changes in other entities (e.g. ooh, X died, I should go scavenge, or become stronger / berserk)

## Done

- A pause system that slows down time until stopped, and then speeds up until normal speed on resume
- refactor: combine all into one entity list
